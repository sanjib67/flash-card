        "Calculation": "We convert SU in IU for \"Basal\", \"Premix\" and \"Rapid\" categories.\r\nWe read the pack that we have and we use different information:\r\n- Number of mL\r\n- Number of IU/mL\r\nWhen number of IU/mL isnot provided, you should consider by default 100IU/ML and multiply by number of ML. When number of mL is not provided, you should consider by default 3ML.\r\nWe identified 3 rules depending on number of IU in IU/ML\r\n\r\nRule 1: In pack recode: IU<300 or 300IU or 300IU/ML If IU<300: the result is a multiplication of the number of mL by the number of IU/mL. Consider that number of IU corresponds to IU/ML.\r\nFor example,molecule INSULIN DETEMIR with pack recode 'CART.PENFILL 100 IU /ML 10 3 ML', IU taken as 100*3 or 300 IU\r\n\r\nRule 2: In pack recode: IU>300 or 300IU or 300IU/ML If IU>300: the result is the number of IU identified in the pack recode.\r\nExcept for product, HUMULIN R 500, apply rule 1\r\nFor example,molecule 'Insulin Human Base' and pack recode 'A.sc 1000 IU 10 Ml X 1', the IU is taken as 1000 IU\r\n\r\nRule 3: In pack recode: IU = 300 or 300IU or 300IU/ML Applicate Rule 2 Except for Insulin Glargine and pack recode contains 1,5ML.\r\nFor example,molecule 'INSULIN LISPRO' and pack recode 'CARTRIDGE 300IU 3ML', the IU is taken as 300 IU, in this case.\r\nHowever, for example, Toujeo with pack recode 'PLUMA SOLOST 300 IU /ML 1 1.50 ML', IU is taken as 300*1.5 or 450 IU"
